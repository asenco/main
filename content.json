        "about": "A Sen & Co Chartered Accountants was established in September 2015 as a sole proprietary firm by CA Anjan Sen in Laketown , Kolkata. After 40 years of service experience as a CA in Indian MNCs both in manufacturing and service sector, we wanted to impart the expertise gathered to the prospective clients, especially to the SMEs and non commercial organization. With the progress in economic legislations in India, formal accounting and reporting is becoming all pervading. The consolidation of Indirect Taxes as one nation one tax, the simplification of Direct Taxes and recent amendments to Companies Act makes it mandatory for organizations to keep proper books with proper internal control and reporting system in place. The submission of returns with the statutory authorities is all getting digitized at its best.  Regular transactions are moving away from Cash and are getting done though the Banking system in  paperless yet secured environment.  With this backdrop Accounting and preparation of Final Accounts and Tax returns cannot remain only a yearend ritual. Moreover awareness that accounting is a tool for management information and decision making is gaining ground even at the bottom of the pyramid. With this perspective our main focus is to build appropriate accounting, internal control and MIS systems for the prospective clients so that with growth they can have robust foundations both for external reporting , filing of returns as well as reliable  internal decision support system.",
